'     ral user controls/modules/class modules.
'     This is a module with a function BMPtoJP
'     G and THATS IT! All you need is one lone
'     of code and your done! No other modules,
'     or any other files are required. It uses
'     VIC32.DLL, you can download it at http:/
'     /education.uregina.ca/courosa/ecmp355/Hy
'     perST/Vic32.dll. Vote if you like.
